These would be something other than software skills. In LinkedIn, they appear in the Featured Skills and endorsements. For example the top skills (https://www.linkedin.com/in/planetoftheweb/)[on my LinkedIn profile] are listed as: User Interface Design, User Experience, Web Development, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please list **at least ten skills**...think of the skills you'll be learning in this or other classes this semester.\n\n### Software/Hardware\n\nThis is a list of the software and hardware you're comfortable with. Don't use specific version of software. If possible, try to make it specific to your career. If you're going into graphic design, then perhaps Photoshop and InDesign might be something you'd list, for 3-D animation, perhaps Maya and for video, After Effects. **At least five**.\n\n### Social Media/Web\n\nA list of links to your public social media profiles or other websites where people can find you; things like LinkedIn, Twitter, Youtube, etc. At the very least, you should link to your website address, and your github repo. If you're a graphic designer, perhaps a link to [Beehance](https://www.behance.net/).\n\n### Work Samples\n\nThese will be images to samples of previous work. If you've done some work for other classes, these will be a great place for them. If you don't already have them online, upload them to your server like you did the photos and create links for them. **At least 5 images.**\n\n## Expectations\n- Use [headlines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) (H1-H6) for headings\n- Use [paragraph](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) tags for paragraphs\n- Use [br tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br), but ONLY for breaking up single lines of text. **DO NOT** use this for formatting your document or adding extra vertical spacing.\n- Convert text links to URLs using the [anchor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) tag\n- Convert links to work samples to images using the [img](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img) tag.\n- Use [ordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and [unordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) lists where necessary.\n- [strong tag]Use the (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) to give strong importance to text.\n- **DO NOT** use any tags not mentioned in this list.\n- **DO NOT** use anything that will format or style the document in any way.\n</ul>","tags":["week 02"],"categories":["assignments"]},{"title":"Create a Lynda.com Account","url":"/assignments/lynda-com/","content":"For this assignment you will create an account for [lynda.com](http://lynda.com/).
