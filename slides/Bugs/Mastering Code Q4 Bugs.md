# Mastering Code Q4 Bugs

### Problem
Should there be an overlay here on 07:14 - 07:18?
### Solution
I noticed a few errors still in the video:

at :48, can we freeze the screen for just a second while I say 'when you click on this right here' and maybe add a circle around the bootstrap link. It's a bit unclear with how fast it was edited.

Also, I noticed that the fades between the sites and the slide bulletpoints at the beginning take a long time and are done while I'm talking, so please shorten them.

Editors left a 'rephrase' at :58. Please remove that before I say 'and how install it with different methods...'

Show an overlay at 2:15 with this URL: [https://git-scm.com/][1], then another one at 2:28 with this URL: [https://nodejs.org/en/][2]. Delete the overlay at 2:08.

Create an overlay for: [https://gist.github.com/planetoftheweb/5b23875fb010f6041437064d524612ce][3] at 07:14 - 07:18

Editors left a 'rephrase' at 4:50. Please remove that before I say 'and I can install packages...'

### Problem
Exercise File Wrong State

### Solution
In this video, the user is supposed to download a file...not use the Github Repo. I had placed a zip file at the repo to download, but unfortunately, as I updated the repo, the zip file disappeared. A few fixes for this:

Delete the overlay at 2:08.
Show an overlay at 2:16 with this URL: [https://git-scm.com/][4], then another one at 2:23 with this URL: [https://nodejs.org/en/][5].

Freeze frame at 2:31, then Create an overlay that is a shortcut URL pointing to this file: http://planetoftheweb.com/i/masteringcode.zip. Can we please just mask the empty preview boxes showing up in the browser here? [https://www.dropbox.com/s/savyp4it2fpj1k4/2017-09-29\_16-59-23.png?dl=0][6]

## 172243-580663-2\_01\_19\_XR15\_JSTemplates.mov
### Problem
The opening brackets are impossible to see

### Solution
This is not really a bug...other than with the editor, so I can't reprogram it...It's a weird bug. At any rate, I highlight every line and while the editor is focused while I'm typing, the user can see it.
