<h2>Class Structure</h2>

I'll start each class reviewing the week's previous assignments. This is an important way for me to give you feedback on the work you're doing for the class and it's part of working in the field. Please don't take it personally, critiques can be difficult to hear, but I have your best interests in mind. I expect you to be here during this time and listen to what I tell you. I also expect you to fix issues I mention during the critiques.


After critiques, I'll give the class a lecture and may give you a link to an [online slide presentation](https://raybo.org/FID). The presentation may have some short exercises for you to finish during class. After the lecture, we'll have some lab time for this course. I expect you to use this time to work through the exercises.


**Do NOT work on other class** coursework during my class. If you don't have any questions or are caught up on your assignments you are welcome to leave the class quietly.

## Assignment Submissions

Assignments in this class are designed to help you work towards your projects. A big part of your grade will depend on you being able to keep up with the assignments. Assignments are due on the time and date mentioned in Canvas. If you fail to turn assignments in when they're due, you'll receive a 0 for the assignment. I will grade assignments roughly the week after they're due. Use that time to correct errors or issues I've mentioned during the critiques for a better grade.


Make sure you read the instructions and ruberic for the assignments. I will award different points as detailed in the ruberic section of the assignments.

## Github Repo

In addition to Canvas, there is a [github repository](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/FID) for this course, where you can ask questions and find slides and other documentation for the course. You'll be creating your own repository for the course in order to do the assignments, so make sure you get started by getting a [github account](https://github.com).

## Asking questions

If you have questions, you can easily ask them using[Github Issues](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/FID/issues). Please make sure you follow the guidelines for issue submissions.


It's not realistic for me to be answering questions about the assignments hours before the assignment is due, so make sure you get started early, so you can give me enough time to answer and for you to react to those answers. I expect you to ask me questions no later than a day before the assignment is due.

## Personal Assistance in Labs

I am an adjunct, which means that I have no office hours or an office at the college. I can answer questions through github issues and will be happy to do so or help you during class. If you need additional assistance, there are a number of labs available throughout the campus. Make sure you[check the schedules](http://www.seminolestate.edu/computers/labhours/) for when the labs are available.
