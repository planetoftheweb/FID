Create a project with at least two web pages that link to one another and contain HTML structural tags. For this project, you should start thinking about what your final site will be like. Because this is a new version of this class, I will not accept portfolio projects for the final project. You should try to build a robust website...like the class website, and it would be a good idea to start working towards that.
