## Information for Github Issue

In the issue you will include the following:

- A link to your public class Github Repository
- A link to your Github Pages site.
- A one or two sentence answer to each of the following questions (pretend you're interviewing for a job in my company)
- What experience do you have building websites?
- What software experience do you currently have?
- What are some of your strongest soft skills ([read this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-companies-need-most-2018-courses-get-them-paul-petrone))?
- Where do you see yourself working after you complete your studies?

## Submitting the Issue

Create a README.md file on your site (help with [markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)). You're welcome to use the same info in the issues or keep it simpler.

Remember that Github as well as this class repo is a public website, so the issues will be public. You don't have to put your name on these.

You will submit a link to your Github Issue in canvas to complete this assignment.
