Before you ask a question, please look through through the issues to see if this question has been answered before.

## Describe what you're attempting to do (Be a specific as possible)

## Describe what is not working about what you're trying

## Include a link to your code
Please upload your code to your class repository and send me a link to the code.

## Validate your code
Before you sumit the issue, make sure both your HTML and CSS validates properly. Validation is the first thing I'll check, and if the code doesn't validate, I'll kick the issue back to you.

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS Linter](http://csslint.net/)

Don't worry about warnings in these validators for now, but fix any errors before you submit an issue. For shorter pieces of code, you can submit a link to [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or [jsbin](http://jsbin.com).
